# Roadmap

## Strategic Vision

AUTONOME begins as a Yield Optimization Subnet on Bittensor.

Its long-term objective is to evolve into a decentralized AI capital coordination network.

The roadmap reflects progressive decentralization, increasing capital complexity, and expanding intelligence scope.

# Phase 2 – Controlled Mainnet Launch

Objective:
Launch limited-capital mainnet version.

Milestones:
- Capital caps per vault
- Real user deposits (controlled scale)
- Monitoring & analytics dashboard
- Risk parameter tuning
- Governance activation

Focus:
- Stability over growth
- Conservative risk enforcement
- Performance tracking transparency

Success Criteria:
- Stable capital growth
- No critical exploit events

---

# Phase 3 – Multi-Strategy Expansion

Objective:
Expand beyond single yield optimization model.

Additions:
- Strategy category segmentation (LP, lending, arbitrage, delta-neutral)
- Multi-vault architecture
- Cross-chain integration modules
- Dynamic capital routing across miners

Focus:
- Increased strategy diversity
- Competitive specialization
- Advanced risk-adjusted scoring

Success Criteria:
- Healthy strategy competition
- Capital allocation efficiency improvement
- Performance dispersion across miner classes

---

# Phase 4 – AI Treasury Management Layer

Objective:
Transition from yield optimization to autonomous treasury coordination.

Expansion:
- DAO treasury allocation
- Risk tier segmentation
- Institutional capital onboarding
- Programmable capital policies

Focus:
- Governance-aligned capital management
- Long-term capital preservation
- Structured AI risk frameworks

Success Criteria:
- DAO adoption
- Treasury allocation use cases
- Risk-adjusted yield stability at scale

---

# Phase 5 – Autonomous Capital Coordination Network

Long-Term Vision:

AUTONOME becomes:

- A decentralized AI capital allocator
- A performance-driven intelligence marketplace
- A coordination layer for autonomous financial agents

Yield is the initial vertical.

Capital intelligence is the ultimate objective.

---

# Governance Evolution

Early Stage:
- Parameter tuning by core contributors

Mid Stage:
- Alpha token-based governance voting

Mature Stage:
- On-chain proposal & execution framework
- Risk parameter community oversight
- Dynamic weight adjustment voting

Governance ensures adaptability.

---

# Sustainability Model

Early Growth:
- Emission-driven incentives
- Bootstrapped miner participation

Scaling Stage:
- Increased vault capital
- Performance-fee dominance

Mature Network:
- Reduced emission dependency
- Capital-driven intelligence economy

---

# Risk Mitigation Timeline

Short Term:
- Strict vault constraints
- Conservative drawdown penalties

Medium Term:
- Statistical anomaly detection
- Validator cartel monitoring

Long Term:
- Adaptive risk parameters
- Governance-driven dynamic scoring weights

---

# Execution Philosophy

AUTONOME prioritizes:

1. Stability before scale
2. Measurable intelligence over speculation
3. Economic alignment over growth hacking
4. Sustainable competition over short-term yield spikes

The roadmap reflects a progression from controlled experimentation to autonomous capital infrastructure.

---

# Final Positioning

AUTONOME – Yield Subnet is not an end product.

It is the first module of a decentralized capital intelligence system built on Bittensor.

Yield optimization proves the model.

Autonomous capital coordination fulfills the vision.
