# Incentive Design

## Design Objective

AUTONOME is designed around a single principle:

Rewards must strictly correlate with measurable, risk-adjusted capital performance.

The incentive model ensures:

- Miners are rewarded only for sustainable yield generation
- Validators are rewarded only for accurate performance evaluation
- Malicious or reckless behavior is economically penalized
- Long-term stability is favored over short-term volatility

---

## Incentive Participants

### 1. Miners (AI Yield Agents)

Miners compete by allocating capital through vault contracts.

To participate, miners must:

- Stake Alpha tokens
- Commit strategy parameters
- Lock participation for an evaluation window

Miners earn rewards only through performance-based scoring.

---

### 2. Validators

Validators compute objective financial metrics from on-chain data.

Validators:

- Assign performance weights
- Influence emission distribution
- Earn rewards proportional to scoring integrity

Validators are not rewarded for opinions.
They are rewarded for computational accuracy.

---

## Miner Incentives

Miner rewards consist of:

### 1. TAO Emissions

Miners receive TAO emissions proportional to validator-assigned weight.

Higher performance score → higher emission allocation.

Emission formula (conceptual):

Miner Reward ∝ Validator Weight × Emission Allocation

---

### 2. Performance Fees

Vault contracts may allocate a percentage of realized profit to:

- Miner (majority share)
- Validator pool
- Subnet treasury

This creates real yield-driven incentive beyond emissions.

---

### 3. Reputation Growth

Consistent performance increases:

- Capital allocation likelihood
- Historical ranking
- Long-term influence in subnet

Reputation is non-transferable and performance-derived.

---

## Miner Penalties

To prevent reckless or malicious behavior:

### 1. Slashing Conditions

A portion of staked Alpha may be slashed if:

- Strategy violates vault execution constraints
- Manipulation attempt detected
- Catastrophic loss beyond risk threshold
- Proven exploitative behavior

---

### 2. Drawdown Threshold Enforcement

If maximum drawdown exceeds defined limit:

- Scoring penalty applied
- Emission reduction triggered
- Potential partial stake reduction

This discourages high-risk gambling strategies.

---

### 3. Inactivity Penalty

Miners failing to execute strategy within window:

- Score decay
- Emission weight reduction

Prevents passive stake farming.

---

## Validator Incentives

Validators are responsible for objective performance measurement.

Validator rewards consist of:

### 1. TAO Emissions

Validators earn emissions proportional to:

- Alignment with consensus scoring
- Accuracy of metric computation
- Consistency over time

---

### 2. Reputation Weight

Validators build credibility through:

- Low deviation from network median
- Reliable submission timing
- Accurate metric reporting

---

## Validator Penalties

To prevent collusion or manipulation:

### 1. Deviation Slashing

If a validator’s score consistently deviates from consensus beyond tolerance:

- Emission reduction
- Potential slashing of validator stake

---

### 2. Collusion Detection

If validator cluster behavior suggests coordinated manipulation:

- Automated penalty triggers
- Reputation downgrade
- Stake slashing

Statistical anomaly detection mechanisms can be applied.

---

## Capital Allocation Incentives

Capital flows toward:

- High-performing miners
- Stable risk-adjusted strategies
- Consistent long-term performers

Poor performers naturally lose:

- Emissions
- Allocation share
- Reputation

The system creates organic Darwinian competition.

---

## Emission Alignment Principle

In AUTONOME:

Emission weight reflects measurable economic productivity.

If a miner generates sustainable yield:

- Validator weight increases
- Emission allocation increases
- Capital allocation increases

If performance declines:

- Weight decreases
- Emission declines
- Allocation declines

No subjective influence is required.

---

## Risk-Adjusted Reward Philosophy

Yield without risk control is not intelligence.

The incentive model explicitly:

- Penalizes volatility
- Penalizes drawdown
- Rewards stability
- Rewards consistency

This ensures subnet health and capital preservation.

---

## Alpha Token Utility in Incentives

Alpha tokens are required for:

- Miner participation
- Strategy bonding
- Validator staking
- Slashing insurance pool
- Governance voting

Alpha ensures that every participant has economic skin in the game.

---

## Long-Term Incentive Stability

The design prevents:

- Short-term exploit farming
- Validator cartel dominance
- Zero-risk passive extraction
- Flash-profit manipulation

AUTONOME incentivizes sustainable capital intelligence.

Performance becomes the only path to reward.
