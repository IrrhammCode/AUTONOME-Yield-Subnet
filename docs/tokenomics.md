# Tokenomics

## Overview

AUTONOME – Yield Subnet operates within the Bittensor emission framework while introducing an internal Alpha token to coordinate economic participation.

The tokenomics design ensures:

- Skin-in-the-game participation
- Slashing-backed accountability
- Performance-aligned emissions
- Sustainable economic circulation

AUTONOME does not rely on artificial inflation.
Rewards are tied to measurable productivity.

# 1. TAO Emissions (External Incentive Layer)

As a Bittensor subnet, AUTONOME receives TAO emissions.

Emission distribution is determined by:

- Validator-assigned weights
- Miner performance scores
- Network consensus alignment

TAO emissions are distributed proportionally to miner performance.

Validators receive TAO proportional to scoring integrity and participation.

---

# 2. Alpha Token (Internal Economic Layer)

The Alpha token governs internal subnet participation.

Alpha is required for:

- Miner staking
- Validator staking
- Slashing collateral
- Governance participation
- Strategy bonding

Alpha ensures that participants carry economic risk.

---

# 3. Alpha Utility Model

## 3.1 Miner Staking

To participate, miners must:

- Lock a minimum Alpha stake
- Maintain stake throughout evaluation window

Higher stake may increase credibility but does not override performance scoring.

Stake functions as:

- Anti-Sybil barrier
- Slashing collateral
- Commitment signal

---

## 3.2 Validator Staking

Validators must:

- Lock Alpha stake
- Maintain scoring consistency
- Accept slashing risk for deviation

Validator stake aligns scoring behavior with subnet integrity.

---

## 3.3 Slashing & Insurance Pool

Slashed Alpha is redistributed to:

- Insurance pool
- Affected capital pool
- Treasury

This creates a capital protection mechanism.

Slashing is triggered by:

- Malicious execution
- Validator manipulation
- Proven exploit behavior
- Severe protocol violation

---

# 4. Fee Model

AUTONOME introduces a performance-based fee structure.

When vault generates profit:

Profit Distribution Example:

- 65% → Miner
- 20% → Validator pool
- 10% → Subnet treasury
- 5% → Insurance reserve

No profit = no performance fee.

This ensures alignment with real yield.

---

# 5. Emission + Fee Synergy

The system creates two revenue layers:

1. TAO emissions (protocol incentive)
2. Vault performance fees (real yield incentive)

This dual-layer reward:

- Encourages long-term participation
- Reduces reliance on emissions alone
- Aligns AI agents with capital productivity

---

# 6. Treasury Model

The subnet treasury accumulates:

- Portion of performance fees
- Portion of slashed Alpha
- Governance-approved allocations

Treasury funds may be used for:

- Protocol upgrades
- Risk mitigation reserves
- Incentive bootstrapping
- Ecosystem expansion

Treasury spending is governance-controlled.

---

# 7. Capital Flow Diagram (Conceptual)

User Capital → Vault → Miner Execution → Performance Evaluation → Profit Realization → Fee Distribution

TAO Emissions → Performance-Based Weight → Miner & Validator Allocation

Alpha Stake → Participation Gate → Slashing Risk → Economic Discipline

---

# 8. Inflation & Sustainability

AUTONOME does not introduce inflationary token mechanics.

Alpha supply mechanics (if implemented) may include:

- Fixed supply
- Controlled emission
- Governance-adjusted distribution

The primary economic driver remains performance.

Long-term sustainability is derived from:

- Real capital yield
- Emission alignment
- Performance-driven allocation

---

# 9. Economic Stability Principles

The tokenomics design avoids:

- Unsustainable yield promises
- Emission-only dependency
- Zero-risk extraction models
- Governance capture through passive accumulation

Instead, it enforces:

- Active contribution requirement
- Continuous performance validation
- Stake-backed accountability

---

# 10. Long-Term Economic Vision

In early stages:

- Emissions incentivize participation
- Performance builds reputation

In mature stages:

- Vault capital scale increases
- Fee revenue dominates
- Emission dependency decreases

AUTONOME transitions from emission-supported competition
to capital-driven intelligence economy.

---

# Summary

Tokenomics in AUTONOME is designed to:

- Align incentives with measurable productivity
- Enforce stake-backed discipline
- Protect capital integrity
- Reward sustainable intelligence

Performance remains the sole path to economic gain.
