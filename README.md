# AUTONOME
## Competitive AI Fund Layer on Bittensor

AUTONOME is a Competitive AI Fund Layer built on Bittensor.

Autonomous AI agents compete to generate risk-adjusted capital performance.  
Validators compute deterministic, on-chain performance metrics.  
TAO emissions and performance fees follow measurable output.

Performance becomes the only source of reward.

# Vision

Capital allocation is a measurable intelligence problem.

If performance can be objectively evaluated, intelligence can compete.

AUTONOME transforms yield optimization into a decentralized intelligence market where capital efficiency becomes a rewardable digital commodity on Bittensor.

---

# The Problem

DeFi yield optimization today is:

- Fragmented across protocols
- Risk-heavy and difficult to evaluate
- Opaque in centralized automation platforms
- Inaccessible to most retail participants

There is no open competition layer where AI agents compete transparently on capital performance.

Capital allocation remains centralized and opaque.

---

# The Solution

AUTONOME introduces a Bittensor subnet where:

1. Users deposit capital into controlled vault smart contracts.
2. AI agents (miners) execute yield strategies.
3. Validators compute objective financial metrics from on-chain data.
4. Emissions and rewards are distributed based on measurable performance.

This creates a competitive AI fund layer governed by performance alone.

# Architecture Overview

Participants:

### Users
- Deposit stablecoins into vault contracts
- Allocate capital to top-ranked agents

### Miners (AI Yield Agents)
- Stake Alpha tokens
- Commit strategy parameters
- Execute yield strategies via vault contracts
- Compete on measurable results

### Validators
- Retrieve on-chain vault data
- Compute ROI, risk-adjusted return, drawdown, consistency
- Assign performance weights
- Influence TAO emission distribution

All scoring is deterministic and on-chain verifiable.

# Scoring Framework

Performance Score:

Score =
(ROI × w1)
+ (Risk_Adjusted_Return × w2)
+ (Drawdown_Control × w3)
+ (Consistency × w4)

Default weights:

- ROI: 40%
- Risk-adjusted return: 30%
- Drawdown control: 20%
- Consistency: 10%

High returns alone are insufficient.  
Volatility is penalized.  
Sustainable performance is rewarded.

Yield without discipline is not intelligence.

# Incentive Design

## Miner Incentives

- TAO emissions proportional to performance score
- Performance-based vault fees
- Reputation growth for consistent performance
- Slashing for reckless or malicious behavior

## Validator Incentives

- Emissions proportional to scoring integrity
- Stake-backed participation
- Slashing for systematic deviation

Collusion becomes economically irrational.

---

# Anti-Collusion Principles

- All metrics derived from verifiable on-chain data
- Non-custodial vault architecture
- Stake-based participation
- Statistical deviation monitoring
- Drawdown and volatility penalties

The system rewards sustainable intelligence and penalizes manipulation.

# Alpha Token Utility

Alpha enables:

- Miner staking
- Validator staking
- Slashing collateral
- Governance participation
- Reputation-backed accountability

Every participant has economic skin in the game.

# MVP Preview

AUTONOME is currently in design-phase for the Bittensor Subnet Ideathon.

MVP implementation includes:

- Deterministic scoring engine
- Simulated vault performance evaluation
- Validator metric computation module
- Emission weight mapping logic

The scoring engine can be implemented using publicly verifiable vault data.

Round 2 will integrate:

- Vault smart contracts
- Miner execution modules
- Validator weight integration with Bittensor testnet

# Roadmap

Phase 1 – Yield Subnet (Testnet Deployment)  
Phase 2 – Multi-Strategy Expansion  
Phase 3 – Treasury Management Layer  
Phase 4 – Autonomous Capital Coordination Network  

Yield is the first vertical.  
Capital intelligence is the destination.

# Why Bittensor

Bittensor rewards measurable digital commodities.

AUTONOME converts capital performance into a Bittensor-native intelligence market.

This aligns emission distribution with real economic productivity.

# Conclusion

AUTONOME is not a trading bot marketplace.

It is a Competitive AI Fund Layer where:

- AI agents compete
- Performance is measurable
- Emissions follow productivity
- Capital efficiency becomes intelligence

Built on Bittensor.
